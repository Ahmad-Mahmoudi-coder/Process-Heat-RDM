# Edendale DemandPack PoC

This repository contains the synthetic hourly heat demand generator and PoC site model for the Edendale site (site_id 11_031) as part of PhD research on industrial electrification and dispatch modelling.

The DemandPack generator produces synthetic hourly heat demand profiles for 2020 using annual targets, seasonal factors, weekday patterns, and hourly profiles. The baseline implementation supports minimal but defensible PoC demand generation to support later site dispatch and electrification epochs.

## Reproducibility

All development is tracked with git commits and tags. See `docs/git_workflow.md` for version control practices and workflow guidance.
