# Grid Upgrade Options Configuration
#
# Defines discrete grid capacity upgrade options for the regional electricity module.
# The module will choose the cheapest option that minimizes total cost:
#   total_cost = upgrade_cost + shed_energy_MWh * VOLL
#
# Each upgrade option specifies:
#   - capacity_MW: Additional headroom capacity (MW)
#   - annual_cost_nzd: Annualized cost of the upgrade (NZD per year)
#
# The module prorates annual costs to hourly costs (divides by 8760 hours/year)
# and compares against shedding costs (shed_MWh * VOLL).

[[upgrades]]
capacity_MW = 0
annual_cost_nzd = 0.0
# Default: no upgrade (baseline)

[[upgrades]]
capacity_MW = 10
annual_cost_nzd = 50000.0
# Example: 10 MW upgrade at $50k/year

[[upgrades]]
capacity_MW = 20
annual_cost_nzd = 90000.0
# Example: 20 MW upgrade at $90k/year

[[upgrades]]
capacity_MW = 30
annual_cost_nzd = 120000.0
# Example: 30 MW upgrade at $120k/year

# Add more upgrade options as needed.
# Options are automatically sorted by capacity_MW (ascending).
# The module selects the option that minimizes total cost (upgrade + shed*VOLL).
